Hello. I am Ruthvik Kodury from Oakridge International School. I have built a classic chess game using Python. Please see below for the screenshots and you can find the whole code in my GitHub account at:

## About Chess

Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. The players, referred to generically as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black; then moves alternate. The object of the game is to checkmate (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
